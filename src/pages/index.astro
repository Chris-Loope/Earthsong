    <h1>Earthsong</h1>
    <p><i>Whispers of the Ancients, Secrets of the Earth</i></p>
    <p>In the heart of the wood, a song does play,
    A chorus of crickets, leaves in disarray,
    The rustle of a bird in its morning flight,
    Mother Earth herself, singing into the night.</p>
    <p>The water sings from mountain to sea,
    A melody that sets our soul set free,
    And the fire at the heart of it all,
    Burning bright, keeping the land never shall fall.</p>
    <p>The wind whispers through the tall trees,
    A message of change and growth to those who will listen,
    Shifting clouds of white and gray,
    Sending seeds of change dancing on a gentle breeze sway.</p>
    <p>The Earth is alive, all around us,
    With lessons and love for us to harness.</p>
