# The First Note

*Spring Equinox 2025*

Dear friends,

Welcome to **The Earthsong Newsletter** — a seasonal letter from our community to yours. We named it after the First Note, the pure tone from which all creation unfolds. Each issue carries that same intention: to offer something true, something grounding, something that helps you walk more gently on this Earth.

## Why a newsletter?

Earthsong lives in the spaces between screens — in forests, on riverbanks, under full moons. But we also know that connection needs tending, and not everyone can gather in person. This newsletter is a bridge: from our community to your inbox, from ancient wisdom to your everyday life.

## What's growing

- **The Codex is live.** Six chapters of Earth-based philosophy are now available to read, share, and reflect upon. Start with [The Origin Symphony](/codex#origin) if you're new.
- **Sacred Cycles calendar.** Every full moon, new moon, solstice, equinox, and eclipse through 2030 — filterable by year and type. [Explore it here](/calendar).
- **From Dominion to Harmony.** Our public stewardship framework is ready for communities to adopt. It includes a 12-month action plan with measurable goals.

## Spring Equinox reflection

Today, day and night stand in perfect balance. The Spring Equinox is a threshold — a moment to pause and ask: *What am I ready to grow?*

The Earthsong teaches that growth is not about force. It's about alignment. The seed doesn't push through soil by will alone; it responds to warmth, to moisture, to the slow turning of the Earth toward light.

What warmth are you turning toward this season?

## Get involved

- **Host a Harmony Circle.** Gather 4-8 people for a 60-minute guided conversation about stewardship. We provide the guide — you provide the space.
- **Adopt a waterway.** Pick a 1-mile stretch of river or stream near you. Visit it quarterly. Care for it.
- **Share the Codex.** Know someone who'd find meaning in these teachings? Send them to [earthsong.io](/codex).
