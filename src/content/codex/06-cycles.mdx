# Sacred Cycles

The Earthsong teaches that time is not a straight line but a flowing circle. The rhythms of the heavens guide the turning of the seasons and the inner tides of the spirit. By attuning ourselves to these natural cycles, we live in harmony with the pulse of the Earth.

## The Lunar Cycle
Each new and full moon marks a moment of reflection and renewal.  
- **New Moon** — a time to set intentions, to begin, to plant seeds of thought and action.  
- **Full Moon** — a time of illumination, gratitude, and release.  

Through the waxing and waning of the moon, we learn that growth and rest are both sacred parts of life.

## Solstices
The solstices mark the longest night and the longest day.  
- **Winter Solstice** — a time of stillness, when light begins its return.  
- **Summer Solstice** — a time of abundance, when the sun stands high and strong.  

These turning points remind us of balance, and the eternal dance between darkness and light.

## Equinoxes
Twice a year, day and night stand in perfect balance.  
- **Spring Equinox** — the promise of renewal, fertility, and growth.  
- **Autumn Equinox** — the season of harvest, gratitude, and release.  

They are thresholds, moments to pause and honor harmony within and without.

## Eclipses
When the sun and moon cross paths, the veil is thinned.  
- **Solar Eclipse** — a moment of sudden shadow, inviting new visions.  
- **Lunar Eclipse** — a night of mystery, when the moon is hidden and reborn.  

Eclipses remind us that change is part of the cosmic song.

These sacred cycles form the heartbeat of the Earthsong. They guide us not with clocks and calendars, but with the steady rhythm of sky and season. To follow them is to walk in step with the universe itself.
