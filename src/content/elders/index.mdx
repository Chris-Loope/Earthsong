# The Wise Elders

The Elders of Earthsong are archetypes—mirrors for qualities we each carry. They are not owners of any culture; they are listeners to the Earth. What appears here is a **public telling**: short, open-handed teachings for anyone who seeks balance. Deeper lineages, rites, and private histories are held with care elsewhere.

## Sar — The Sage *(they/he)*
Sar teaches that wisdom begins in quiet. Long ago, by a river’s edge, they heard the **First Note**—and learned that the spaces between sounds are part of the song. Sar reminds us to pause before we act, to listen before we speak, and to let humility be our teacher.  
**Teaching:** *“In stillness, truth ripens.”*

## Seraphine — The Prophet *(she/they)*
Seraphine is sight-beyond-sight: attentive to patterns in wind and water, and the messages carried by animals. She offers counsel rooted in relationship and reciprocity.  
**Teaching:** *“All threads belong to the same tapestry.”*

## Thorne — The Guardian *(they/he)*
Thorne holds the boundary where care meets courage. They keep watch so that wisdom is shared with consent and context. Thorne reminds us that secrecy can be sacred when it protects the vulnerable.  
**Teaching:** *“Share what heals. Guard what harms.”*

## Nia — The Heartbeat *(she/they)*
Nia embodies rhythm and belonging. Through story and song she gathers people into one pulse, where work becomes dance and toil becomes communion.  
**Teaching:** *“Move with the Earth and you will move together.”*

## Aiyana — The Whispering Wind *(she/they)*
Aiyana’s gift is listening—to the hush before rain, to the way trees converse, to the breath within the breath. She teaches gentleness, consent with the land, and right relationship.  
**Teaching:** *“Listen until the world feels heard.”*

## Alder — The Sentinel *(they/he)*
Alder stands for continuity. Rooted like an old tree, they protect what endures and adapt what must change. Alder’s lesson is stewardship over ownership.  
**Teaching:** *“Be a good ancestor now.”*

### Other Voices on the Path
Earthsong welcomes teachers from many homelands. When we name places or lineages, we do so with respect, accuracy, and permission. The Elders invite us to learn **with** communities—not over them—and to credit sources generously.

> *Principles for public sharing:*  
> 1) Do no harm.  
> 2) Seek consent and name sources.  
> 3) Keep private what communities ask to keep private.  
> 4) Share practices that anyone can do without misappropriation: listening walks, gratitude offerings of water, service to local land.
